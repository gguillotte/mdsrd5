  <section id="conditions" class="level2">
  <h2>Conditions</h2>
  <p>Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.</p>
  <p>A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.</p>
  <p>If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse.</p>
  <p>A creature either has a condition or doesn't. The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.</p>
  <section id="blinded" class="level4">
  <h4>Blinded</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.</li>
  <li>Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="charmed" class="level4">
  <h4>Charmed</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.</li>
  <li>The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="deafened" class="level4">
  <h4>Deafened</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.</li>
  </ul>
  </section>
  <section id="exhaustion" class="level4">
  <h4>Exhaustion</h4>
  <p>Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.</p>
  <table style="width:71%;">
  <colgroup>
  <col style="width: 11%" />
  <col style="width: 59%" />

  <td style="text-align: left;">Disadvantage on ability checks</td>

  <tr class="even">
  <td style="text-align: center;">2</td>
  <td style="text-align: left;">Speed halved</td>

  </tr>
  <tr class="even">
  <td style="text-align: center;">6</td>
  <td style="text-align: left;">Death</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.</p>
  <p>A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.</p>
  <p>An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.</p>
  <p>Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.</p>
